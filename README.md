# Student-Academic-Performance-Project
Predicting Student Academic Performance Based on Sleep and Study Hours using Data Analysis and Visualization.

This project explores the impact of **weekly self-study hours** and **daily sleep hours** on students' academic performance using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The dataset includes 2000 student records, with academic scores in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, and computes the average performance to analyze patterns and relationships.

## üìà Key Analyses Performed

- **Descriptive statistics**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- **Visualizations**:
  - Distribution plots of key features
  - Scatter plots of study/sleep vs. performance
  - Standard deviation thresholds
- **Hypothesis testing** using **t-test** for sleep hours effect
- **Model Training** (optional): Simple regression models using study and sleep hours

## üß† Project Objective

To analyze how much **study time** and **sleep duration** impact **academic success**, and visualize these relationships clearly to aid educational decision-making.
